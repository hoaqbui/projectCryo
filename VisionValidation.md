# Vision Alignment: Project Cryo

This document serves as a self-check tool to ensure all new features, assets, and systems align with the core vision of Project Cryo.

## 1. Artistic Vision Alignment
*Goal: Maintain the "Cozy SRPG" aesthetic.*

*   **Palette**: Does this asset use the defined 16-color Time Fantasy palette?
*   **Seasonality**: How does this environment or creature change visual state between Summer and Winter?
*   **Atmosphere**: Does the design evoke "Cozy Mystery" rather than "Dark Horror"?
*   **Cohesion**: Does the UI feel like an extension of the world (e.g., frost-transparency in winter)?

## 2. Design Vision Alignment
*Goal: Maintain "Automated Agency" and SRPG tactical depth.*

*   **Tactical Depth**: Does this creature's stat/ability kit create a unique niche on a 5x5 grid?
*   **Luck Impact**: Is the "Luck" stat meaningfully influencing this system beyond simple RNG?
*   **Automation**: Does this mechanic respect the "Player as Director" philosophy (i.e., set conditions, then watch)?
*   **Engagement**: Are there enough "Lucky Moments" (weights/biases) to make the automated battle exciting to watch?
*   **Grid Density**: Does the 5x5 space feel tight and interactive, or are units wasting turns on movement?
