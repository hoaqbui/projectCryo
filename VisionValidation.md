# Vision Alignment: Project Cryo

This document serves as a self-check tool to ensure all new features, assets, and systems align with the core vision of Project Cryo.

## 1. Artistic Vision Alignment
*Goal: Achieve a premium boutique look on mobile hardware.*

*   **Mobile PBR Clarity**: Does characters' PBR reactions feel high-fidelity on mobile screens without Lumen?
*   **Tier Parity**: Does the "Mid-Range" build retain the core aesthetic identity (banding/halftone) of the "High-End" build?
*   **Tiled Halftone legibility**: Are dot patterns clear and crisp on 5-7 inch mobile displays?
*   **Mobile Frame Stability**: Is 60fps maintained during 5v5 skirmishes on target devices?
*   **Static Atmospheric Mood**: Does the baked lighting successfully 'drench' the mobile scenes in mood?

## 2. Design Vision Alignment
*Goal: Maintain "Automated Agency" and Ogre-style tactical depth.*

*   **Tactical Depth**: Does this creature's stat/ability kit create a unique niche on a 5x5 grid?
*   **Luck Impact**: Is the **Luck (LUK)** stat meaningfully influencing weightings as specified in the **Design Strategy**?
*   **Automation Satisfaction**: Does the automated resolution feel like a rewarding "reveal" of the player's strategy?
*   **Weight Transparency**: Is it clear *why* a creature made a specific move (visible AI biases)?
*   **Grid Density**: Does the 5x5 space feel tight and interactive, or are units wasting turns on movement?
