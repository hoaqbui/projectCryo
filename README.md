# Project Cryo

Project Cryo is a creature-collection RPG built in **Unity**, featuring a cozy Stardew Valley-inspired world and a tactical **5x5 Grid-Based Auto-Battler**.

## 🚀 Vision
The goal is to blend the farming/sim tranquility of *Stardew Valley* with a deep, automated Tactical SRPG system where creature performance is driven by **Speed** and **Luck**.

## 🛠️ Technical Setup (Unity)
To begin implementation, we recommend the following core Unity packages:

1.  **[The Farming Engine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/the-farming-engine-175518)**: Core framework for world interactions, inventory, farming, and persistence.
2.  **[Turn-Based Strategy Framework](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/turn-based-strategy-framework-108023)**: Orchestrates the tactical grid, pathfinding, and turn management.
3.  **[Dialogue System for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai-audio-npc/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672)**: For branching narrative and quest management.
4.  **[Unity UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html)**: For the custom battle interface and HUD overlays.
