# Project Cryo

Project Cryo is a creature-collection RPG built in **Unity**, featuring a cozy Stardew Valley-inspired world and a tactical side-view battle arena.

## 🚀 Vision
The goal is to blend the farming/sim tranquility of *Stardew Valley* with a deep, tactical *Active Time Battle (ATB)* system.

## 🛠️ Technical Setup (Unity)
To begin implementation, we recommend the following core Unity packages:

1.  **[The Farming Engine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/the-farming-engine-175518)**: This serves as the primary framework for world interactions, inventory, farming, and data persistence.
2.  **[Dialogue System for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai-audio-npc/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672)**: For branching narrative and quest management.
3.  **[Unity UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html)**: For the custom tactical battle interface.

## 📂 Documentation
- **[PRD.md](./PRD.md)**: Product Requirements and high-level vision.
- **[TDD.md](./TDD.md)**: Technical architecture, ScriptableObject schemas, and ATB loop logic.

## 📜 Next Steps
1.  Initialize a Unity 2022.3+ project in this directory.
2.  Import **The Farming Engine**.
3.  Implement the **CreatureDefinition** ScriptableObject based on the schemas in [TDD.md](./TDD.md).
